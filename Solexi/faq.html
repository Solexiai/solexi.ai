The process works in 5 steps: 1) Upload memories (photos, videos, documents) to a secure encrypted vault, 2) Build your family tree with unlimited generations and relationships, 3) Create an AI voice avatar by recording your voice and stories, 4) Set transmission rules defining when and how heirs access your legacy, 5) Your memories are preserved for 100+ years with military-grade AES-256 encryption across geographically distributed data centers."

Ancestry excels at historical research and DNA testing, FamilySearch provides free historical records. Many users use Solexi alongside Ancestry - research your past with Ancestry, preserve your present and future with Solexi."

The process involves: 1) Voice Recording Phase: You record 2-5 hours of your voice telling stories, answering questions, and sharing wisdom. 2) AI Training: Neural TTS (Text-to-Speech) models learn your voice patterns, tone, cadence, and expressions. Natural Language Processing captures your personality, humor, and communication style. 3) Knowledge Base: Your stories, experiences, and wisdom are encoded into a vector database. 4) Interactive Avatar: Future generations can ask questions and receive responses in your authentic voice with 99.2% similarity (measured by MOS score). The avatar understands context, family relationships, and responds naturally. Response time is under 2 seconds. Supports 50+ languages. Voice biometric encryption prevents unauthorized cloning."

Your data is more secure than traditional cloud storage services."

How it works: 1) Create Messages: Record video messages, voice memos, or write letters for your family. 2) Set Triggers: Choose when messages are delivered - after death (verified by death certificate), on specific dates (birthdays, anniversaries, graduation days), on life events (child's 18th birthday, wedding, first child), on holidays (every Christmas, anniversary of your passing). 3) Assign Recipients: Specify who receives each message and when. 4) Secure Storage: Messages are encrypted and stored securely until delivery time. 5) Automatic Delivery: When the trigger occurs, recipients automatically receive notifications and access to your message. 6) Verification System: Death verification through official documents, notary confirmation, or trusted contacts. Use cases: Birthday messages for grandchildren not yet born, wedding day advice for your children, life lessons for milestone ages (18, 21, 30), final goodbyes and expressions of love, family recipes and traditions, inheritance instructions, forgiveness and reconciliation. This feature helps you remain present in your family's life even after you're gone."

This means: Storage Guarantee: Your data will be stored securely for at least 100 years, spanning 3-4 generations. Format Migration: As technology evolves, we automatically migrate your files to current formats (e.g., converting old video codecs to new standards) at no additional cost. Hardware Redundancy: Multiple copies across geographically distributed data centers with automatic failover. Company Continuity: Legal trusts and escrow arrangements ensure your data persists even if Solexi.ai is acquired or dissolved. Heir Access: Your designated heirs can access the vault using their cryptographic keys after verification. Cost Protection: Preservation costs are locked in at signup, no surprise fees for your heirs. Why 100 years? This covers great-grandchildren and ensures 3-4 generations can access your legacy. For comparison: most cloud storage services offer no long-term guarantees, physical media (photos, VHS) degrades in 10-30 years, hard drives fail after 5-10 years. With Solexi, your memories outlast you and stay accessible for your descendants."

                    "@type": "Answer",
                    "text": "Heir access uses cryptographic keys and multi-party verification for security. The process: 1) Designation: You designate heirs in your Solexi account, specifying who gets access to what content and when. 2) Heir Keys: Each heir receives a unique cryptographic key (securely delivered via physical mail, email, or trusted intermediary). 3) Activation Triggers: Keys only activate when conditions are met - Death verification (official death certificate uploaded), Specific date reached (e.g., heir turns 18), Both conditions (death AND date), Inactivity period (no account access for specified time). 4) Verification Process: When you pass away, designated contacts (family, lawyer, executor) submit death certificate through secure portal. Our verification team reviews documentation (typically 24-48 hours). Multiple parties must confirm to prevent fraud. 5) Access Granted: Once verified, heirs receive notification their key is activated. They log in with their unique key to access designated content. They can view, download, but cannot delete your original vault (preservation guarantee). 6) Graduated Access: You can set different access levels - Full vault access, specific folders only, read-only vs full control, time-delayed revelation (wait 1 year after death to see certain content). 7) Security: Multi-party computation prevents any single person from unauthorized access. Even Solexi cannot access your vault without heir keys. Impossible to forge or bypass - cryptographic security. This system ensures only your chosen heirs access your legacy, exactly when and how you intended."
